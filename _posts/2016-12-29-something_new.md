I've been meaning to start a blog for a long time. Years, even. Which is why I find it funny that after finally getting around to pulling the trigger I'm not exactly sure what I should even say.

I may as well start with the most basic question; why do I even want to blog? Over the years I've had a dozens of reasons, most of which have slipped away with the passing of time. But there are a few I keep coming back to.

1. Self Serving Reasons
    1. Thinking Out Loud
    2. Poor Memory
    3. My Programming Heroes Blog

2. Altruistic Reasons
    1. Teaching Is Its Own Reward
    2. Giving Back / The Shoulders of Giants


## 1.1 Thinking Out Loud

By writing here, I hope to bring some clarity to my thoughts and learnings.

In another life (i.e. college) I was an English major which basically means I spent 4 years writing paper after paper. At some point I noticed a trend; when I started writing I'd have an idea, but by the time I finished I'd have an opinion. In other words, the process of writing forced me to learn about and give (deep) consideration to my subject.

I'd spend hours looking at it from different angles, weighing interpretations, constructing arguments and counter arguments, distilling those ideas, and eventually serializing it all into a comprehensible sequence of words (aka an essay). Whether I reaffirmed my initial position, flipped sides, or when off in a completely different direction, I'd *think*. Even when the subject didn't require analysis, the act of writing would force me focus on and better understand a topic.

Before I move on, I should briefly mention that "thinking out loud" has also been an invaluable technique for working through writer's block. When I don't know what to sat about a topic, I can always fall back to writing my stream of consciousness or typing out a letter. "Hey Mom, Have I ever told you about functional programming? ..."


## 1.2 Poor Memory

Oh, my poor memory. How weak. How frail. How unfit to bear even the lightest remembrance.

One of the main reasons I want to write is to remember. Truth be told, my memory is pretty shit. I don't mean in your average, run-of-the-mill "Oh, I *always* forget names when I meet someone new" way. I have trouble retaining pretty much everything. It's a problem.

Over the years I've developed a number of coping strategies including: taking notes, calendaring all my commitments, intentionally putting objects where I can't lose/forget/ignore them, and leaning on friend (sorry friends), and repetition.

Having a blog means I'll have a record of what I've done, what I thought about it, and why. If I forget something, I want a way to look it up. And if I didn't blog it, that's a signal that maybe I should have & I can start drafting. And, of course, the act of writing also has memory-enhancing properties.


## 1.3 My Programming Heroes Blog

An alternative, less charitable title for this section might be "Getting Exposure".

Most of my programming heroes blog. In fact, most of them became my heroes because they blog. I'd find myself Googling a problem and consistently coming across the same authors either on their own sites or guest writing for another publication. After coming across the same name X times, it starts to stick with you.

Humility makes me want to demure and say I'm nowhere near as good as my heroes. But the truth is they're also humans. They have jobs, make things, tinker, and explore. The biggest common trait my heroes have is that is that they write down and share their findings.

A lot of my heroes also give talks at meetups and conferences: something I'm also interested in. Blogging is good prep for that in that it helps get your name out there and helps exercise those explanatory muscles.


## 2.1 Teaching Is Its Own Reward

You know the old (but [surprisingly modern][1]) "teach a man to fish" thing? It helps the man, but it turns out the teacher feels pretty good about it too.

I'm not an "alpha." Never have been and have no desire to be. I'd much rather help someone accomplish their goal than break out on my own. I genuinely enjoy facilitating what other people are trying to do. Teaching is like facilitating, but *moar*.

There's a unique satisfaction to tinkering, experimenting, and eventually mastering something, then passing on what you've learned and seeing someone's eyes light up when they get it.



## 2.2 Giving Back / The Shoulders of Giants

Human history is made up of countless improvements and tweaks to existing ideas. Our species makes strides not as individuals, but through the collective progress we all make in aggregate. Even the greatest of us builds on what came before.

I don't have a formal background in computer science. I learned by searching around the Internet, reading articles, and experimenting. I owe my career to the countless authors that took some time out of their days to log their experiences. To that end, I feel it incumbent upon me to share what I've learned in the hopes that it will help someone else.

I may not break new ground or have the best posts, but hopefully I can give another point of view on an issue. If I'm lucky, I'll help an idea click for someone. And in the worst case, where no one even reads this, I'll always have my selfish motivators to fall back on.
