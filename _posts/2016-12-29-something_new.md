I've been meaning to start a blog for a long time. Years, even. Which is why I find it funny that after finally getting around to pulling the trigger I'm not exactly sure what I should even say.

I may as well start with the basics: Why?

Over the years I've had a dozens of reasons, most of which have slipped away with the passing of time. But there are a few I keep coming back to.

1. Poor memory
2. Giving back
3. Exposure
3. My heroes blog


## 1. Poor Memory

One of the main reasons I want to write is so I have a record.

Truth be told, my memory is pretty shit. I don't mean in your average, run-of-the-mill "Oh, I *always* forget names" way. I mean I have trouble retaining pretty much everything, large or small.

* Where are my keys?
* Did I need to renew my lease this month or *last*?
* Did I take any vacation this year? When is my partner's birthday?

I'm only able to lead a normal-ish life is coping mechanisms: repetition, taking notes, using a calendar, repetition, putting things where I can't lose/forget them, leaning on friends (sorry friends), and repetition.

Most people are pretty confident about things: they *know* certain things are true. Not me, though. I have recollections, leanings, biases, and opinions; but I don't *know* much of anything. Rather, I'll have an inclination that X is a certain way, so I'll say "I think X is like this." But I don't *know* until I double-check.

Blogging about the projects I work on seems like a good way to solve this problem. If I forget something, I want a way to look it up; to see what I did and the conclusion I drew. If the conclusion is in doubt, I can revise the steps. And if the steps were flawed, I have a starting point to revise my process.

Also, blogging the details of a project has the added benefit of forcing me to spend more time thinking about what I did and why, which in turn helps the memory get settled in my head instead of just falling out.
